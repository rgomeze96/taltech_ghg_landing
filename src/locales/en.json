This site is designed to provide free tools and an open source Estonian emission factors database for greenhouse gas(GHG) quantification. Click the button on the top banner to access the free GHG accounting tool for enterprises and organisations. If you do not have a user account yet, please sign in with the test account email: tester@ghgtest.com and password: ghgtester%%%. Please be aware that any user can access this test account and change the data. Please send an e-mail to support@ghg.ee to open your private account. In our response, we will provide instructions that will help you fill in the details of your organisation and get started with the GHG accounting.",
		"aboutThisProjectTitle": "About ghg.ee",
		"aboutThisProjectText": "At ghg.ee, TalTech will publish free greenhouse gas calculation tools and an open database for GHG emission factors. Our mission is to enhance the uptake of greenhouse gas accounting across society by developing free browser-based tools and sharing the emission factors we apply in our work. The first one of our tools is for organisations, and it applies the same method that we have used in our own greenhouse gas inventory. Later this year we will publish more content on this site: an open GHG emission factor database with an API, and a free tool for the carbon footprint assessment of buildings.",

		"toolTitle": "Tool",
		"toolText": "The open TalTech greenhouse gas accounting tool for enterprises and organisations applies a hybrid calculation method to assess organisation's annual greenhouse gas emissions. Our method combines the environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) method with the process- LCA method in accordance with the guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Estonian Ministry of Climate. The data can be inserted in the tool row-by-row or using a specific MS Excel spreadsheet to collect the data sector by sector. The results can be printed out or exported as a csv file that opens as an MS Excel spreadsheet. We will provide user manuals and video tutorials on this web site.",
		"emissionFactorDatabaseTitle": "Emission factor database",
		"emissionFactorDatabaseText": "Our calculation tool automatically proposes an emission factor from our database. You can use our database value or type in a custom emission factor. The emission factors can also be later sourced from our database on an MS Excel spreadsheet. Currently, our emission factor database is designed to serve mainly Estonian organisations. We are working to extend it to serve some other countries as well.",
		"estimateTheAccuracyTitle": "Estimate the accuracy of your GHG inventory",
		"estimateTheAccuracyText": "Our tool provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy of your GHG inventory. The accuracy of each input is estimated by choosing a Tier for the input. Choose Tier 3 if you are using the most sophisticated input data available. Choose Tier 1 if your input is based on national averages rather than on organisation-specific data. Any input data based on expenditure will be automatically attributed to Tier 0. The concept of Tiers originates from the IPCC methodology and the tiered hybrid LCA method we apply in our tool. Self-evaluation of data quality and inventory accuracy is necessary when you monitor your organisationâ€™s GHG emissions over several years and want to apply so called TRACC principles in your GHG reporting: transparency, relevance, accuracy, completeness and consistency.",
		"turnYourFinancialTitle": "Turn your financial accounting report into a GHG inventory",

		"toolFeaturesByCustomerTitle": "Tool features by customer needs",
		"toolFeaturesByCustomerText": "If you feel uncomfortable using the tool because some specific tool features or functions are missing, please email us at support@ghg.ee and we can provide you with an offer about adding the missing features in the tool. We can develop the tool functionality based on our customer needs with a one-time cost that is less than the annual licence fee of a commercial SaaS tool.",
